# My Leetcode Challenges
I started learning to code in November on 2020. Why?! 

* To get better
* To get more respected
* To have the ability to build.

And because a majority of all jobs will require some form of coding or scripting by 2022. Hell even my current job references SQL, HTML, and SOLR QUERY Language nearly every day.
